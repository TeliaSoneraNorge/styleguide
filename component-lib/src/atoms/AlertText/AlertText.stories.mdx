# AlertText

Status: _finished_

Category: Notifications

Use this component when you want to make the user aware of something, for instance:

- the chat to customer service is closed
- unpaid amount on invoice if date is past due date

It's recommended to use this component with any heading component and only for short texts (for instance maximum five words).

## Default

<AlertText>Chat is closed</AlertText>
