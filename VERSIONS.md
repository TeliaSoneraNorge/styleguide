# Versioning

This file should contain all changes in the Styleguide.

- Use version in package.json ("version": "1.1.0")
- The numbers represent, "Major", "Minor" and "Patch"
- "Major" is reserved for rewrites of the styleguide, or entire Telia design rebrands (extremely rare).
- "Minor" in this context means _breaking changes_ - such as a change in a components HTML structure, or a change in a CSS class name.
- "Patch" is reserved for smaller CSS changes, tweaks and improvements. Styleguide users are safe to upgrade to new patches.
  Also, _new components_ and _new component variants_ are also patches, since they do not break anything for other channels.

For Major and Minor changes in version you must notify everyone in the #styleguide Slack Channel.
