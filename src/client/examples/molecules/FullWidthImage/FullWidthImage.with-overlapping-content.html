<div class="full-width-image full-width-image--with-mask full-width-image--with-content-overlap">
    <img class="full-width-image__image" src="https://placekitten.com/1440/440" alt="Kitten" />
</div>

<div class="container container--medium container--white-bg container--overlapping-full-width-image">
    <div class="container container--small">
        <p>
            If you add the <code>--with-content-overlap</code> CSS class then the
            next piece of content will overlap the image.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's recommended to wrap the overlapping content in a <code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;</code>
            to make it responsive and <code>&lt;section class="container--small"&gt;</code>
            to give the content a max-width to restrict the line length in the text for readability (accessibility) reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you also specify the <code>container--extra-padding-top</code> CSS class
            the container will be padded on top. This is solved with a modifier class
            because not all elements within the main-content element should have padding on top.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you specify the <code>container--overlapping-full-width-image</code> CSS class
            the overlapping content will look the same on smaller devices until it wraps
            beneath the image on the smallest devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add <code>main-content--bg-color-white</code> if you want the background-color to be white.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also recommended to keep the height of the next piece of content tall enough
            to cover the mask.
