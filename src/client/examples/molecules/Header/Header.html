            <p>If you add the <code>--with-content-overlap</code> CSS class then the next piece of content, such as this Focus Box, will overlap the header.</p>
            <p>When using the header with <code>--with-content-overlap</code> it is recommended to use a component like <code>Focus Box</code> as the next component on the page.</p>
            <p>This is recommended to keep the overlapping content tall enough to cover the mask.</p>
