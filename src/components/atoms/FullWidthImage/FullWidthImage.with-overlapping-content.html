<div class="full-width-image full-width-image--with-mask full-width-image--with-content-overlap">
    <img class="full-width-image__image" src="https://placekitten.com/1600/500" alt="Kitten" />

<div class="main-content main-content--bg-color-white main-content--padding-top main-content--padded-sides">
    <section class="body-text-container">
        <p>If you add the <code>--with-content-overlap</code> CSS class then the
            next piece of content will overlap the image.
        </p>
        <p>It's recommended to wrap the overlapping content in a <code><span><</span>div class="main-content"></code>
            to make it responsive and <code><span><</span>section class="body-text-container"></code>
            to give the content a max-width to restrict the line length in the text for readability (accessibility) reasons.
        </p>
        <p>If you also specify the <code>main-content--padding-top</code> CSS class
            the main-content element will be padded on top. This is solved with a modifier class
            because not all elements within the main-content element should have padding on top.
        </p>
        <p>If you specify the <code>main-content--padded-sides</code> CSS class
            the overlapping content will look the same on smaller devices until it wraps
            beneath the image on the smallest devices.
        </p>
        <p>Add <code>main-content--bg-color-white</code> if you want the background-color to be white.
        </p>
        <p>It's also recommended to keep the height of the next piece of content tall enough
            to cover the mask.
